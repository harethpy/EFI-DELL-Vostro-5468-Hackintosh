- Map your own ports using UTBMap tool on Windows
- Airportltwm is not supported in Sonoma or later. Use ltwm+heliport.

- Generate them using SSDTime on Windows
- Ensure you add the Patches generated by SSDTime to config.plist as well

***Additional Information***
In ``Booter -> Quirks``:   
  Enable ``AllowRelocationBlock``, ``SyncRuntimePermissions`` and ``EnableWriteUnprotector`` otherwise boot will fail   
Fixed bluetooth by Enabling HashServices  
Audio Layout is 21, ALC256    
SMBios is MacBookPro16,2 

**Updating from Ventura to Sonoma or later?**
Ensure you enable the quirks i've mentioned first, then disable SecureBootModel in config.plist by changing it to ``Disabled``   
Clear your NVRAM using ResetNVRAMEntry.efi   
Boot to your macOS and re-run the Sonoma or later installer   
Your mac will restart and boot to the installer, there should be about 2-3 reboots, always boot to the macOS installer until it vanish.   
Enable SecureBootModel after update.

I'll slowly update this guide to include more details, for now, this will help many people.
